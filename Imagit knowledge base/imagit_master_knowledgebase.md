IMAGIT MASTER KNOWLEDGE BASE

---

Company Overview
Imagit is a professional IT infrastructure services company specializing in nationwide and international field engineering, installation, and managed services. It operates primarily across the U.S. and Canada with the capability to support global projects through strategic partner networks. The company focuses on physical IT infrastructure — including cabling, network hardware installation, access control, surveillance, Wi-Fi systems, and multi-site deployments. Imagit is owned by Brian Gardner, headquartered in Illinois, and functions as an S‑corporation.

Imagit’s target clients are multi-location enterprises such as Regus, Hear Audiology, and other national retail or professional-service networks. These clients typically lack dedicated on-site IT support at branch locations, relying on Imagit’s dispatch network of 400+ contractors. Imagit serves industries like retail, healthcare, legal, and financial services — any vertical with distributed offices requiring standardized installations or break-fix coverage.

Core Services and Capabilities
Imagit provides a range of IT infrastructure and technology deployment services:
- Nationwide Install & Break-Fix Support: Field technician dispatch for routers, switches, firewalls, wireless access points, cameras, and access control.
- Structured Cabling and Wi-Fi Deployments: Installation, certification, and testing of data and voice cabling, often as part of full site buildouts.
- Managed Network Services: Device monitoring, support escalation, and ongoing maintenance contracts.
- Device-as-a-Service (SiAFi Program): Bundled hardware, software licensing, and lifecycle management with predictable monthly pricing.
- Site Surveys and Pre-Installation Assessments: Data collection, drawings, and environmental validation prior to installs.
- Global Coordination: Partnered implementations for multinational organizations needing standardized deployments.

Imagit differentiates itself by combining a deep bench of U.S.-based technicians, automation in scheduling and reporting, and a flexible operational model that scales from one-off jobs to multi‑hundred‑site rollouts.

Operational Model and Processes
Ticketing and Job Management
Imagit uses Autotask PSA as its central ticketing and workflow management system. Dispatchers and project managers assign work to technicians through Autotask, while job intake can originate from either direct client requests or internal sales orders. Field technicians currently complete job reports using two JotForms — one for single‑day service calls and another for multi‑day work orders. These forms are web‑based and do not require login credentials, simplifying contractor submission.

Planned App Integration
A custom internal app is being developed to replace the JotForms. This application will feature:
- A landing page for technicians to select either single‑day or multi‑day report workflows.
- Automatic prefill of ticket data using the Autotask ticket number.
- Secure data storage that links each submission to the relevant Autotask record.
- Optional client portal expansion for future use.

Dispatchers (Professional Services Coordinators, or PSCs) manage daily job assignments and communication with technicians. Project Managers oversee larger, multi‑site or phased deployments. Both roles coordinate through Autotask and are supported by templates, workflows, and SLAs designed for consistency.

Financial and System Integrations
Imagit currently uses QuickBooks Enterprise Desktop for accounting and bill.com for paying subcontractors. The long‑term vision includes automated pushing of contractor payments into bill.com based on approved job completions in Autotask. Sales and operations teams maintain detailed margin tracking at the job level, enabling profitability reporting across projects and clients.

Typical margin targets are defined by service category:
- 55% gross margin for higher‑tier professional services.
- 25–30% gross margin for hardware resale or bundled managed services.
- Flat‑rate and variable‑rate models available depending on client contract type.

Imagit manages revenue streams for fixed‑price projects, hourly rate services, product sales, and prepaid block-hour packages. The company also leverages tiered pricing for technicians based on skill level and market rate.

Tiered Roles and Salary Framework
Professional Services Coordinators (PSCs) are divided into three tiers:
- PSC Tier 1: Entry‑level, executes defined workflows and templates created by senior staff. Typical salary $50,000–$60,000.
- PSC Tier 2: Manages more complex scheduling, client communication, and documentation. Salary range $60,000–$75,000.
- PSC Tier 3: Oversees major accounts and manages escalations. Salary range $70,000–$90,000.

Project Managers generally start around $75,000 and scale upward based on experience and account scope.

Sales and Client Flow
Imagit's sales team generates scopes of work for various pricing structures:
- Flat‑rate per site (common for standardized installs).
- Variable rate (hourly or day‑rate for complex jobs).
- Product sales tied to installation services.
- Prepaid hour blocks for clients requiring ongoing support.

Once a proposal is accepted, the project transitions through the following flow:
1. Sales creates or updates the Autotask ticket.
2. Dispatch assigns resources and coordinates logistics.
3. Technician completes work and submits job report via form or app.
4. Project management validates completion.
5. Finance issues invoice via QuickBooks.
6. Contractor payments processed via bill.com integration.

Pronto Recovery Integration
Pronto Recovery is a separate single‑member LLC, also owned by Brian Gardner. While legally distinct, Pronto and Imagit are now combining operations and personnel. The integration strategy involves:
- Shared leadership (Eric Michaels overseeing both entities).
- Unified dispatch and project coordination infrastructure.
- Combined service catalog emphasizing global reach and compliance.
- Potential Imagit‑by‑Pronto branding alignment.

Pronto specializes in compliant sourcing of critical minerals and supply chain operations but shares digital and service‑process expertise with Imagit. The companies are being strategically unified under Imagit for efficiency, with Pronto positioned as a brand extension or division.

Margin, Pricing, and Quoting Framework
Imagit's financial modeling includes markup and gross margin calculations that support multiple pricing tiers. Sales proposals often include both business‑hours and after‑hours rates. Large‑scale projects use day‑rate or half‑day pricing. Profitability reporting tracks cost of technician time, travel, and materials against client billables.

Imagit's systems are designed for future automation of quote‑to‑invoice workflows, margin reporting, and technician compensation validation.

---

Future Vision and Development
Imagit's roadmap includes:
- Full automation of the field‑service workflow through a proprietary app that integrates Autotask, billing, and subcontractor management.
- AI‑based dispatch optimization and resource allocation.
- Profitability dashboards for job and client analytics.
- Expansion of SiAFi Device‑as‑a‑Service offering to include licensing and EOL refresh management.
- Client portal access for work order tracking and SLA visibility.

Communication Preferences and Brand Tone
Emails and documents from Imagit should maintain a professional but conversational tone. The owner prefers no bold text or formatting in email communications to ensure natural appearance. Subject lines should use title case, with each word capitalized. Internal communication emphasizes operational clarity, quick responses, and accountability.

---

Summary
Imagit is an established IT field‑service organization designed to deliver nationwide and global technology deployment through efficient dispatch coordination, standardized workflows, and integrated systems. The company’s next phase involves merging operations with Pronto Recovery, expanding automation, and consolidating systems under a unified digital platform for scale, profitability, and transparency.
